# Working with Interns

This guide helps you get the most out of your APM intern and create a valuable experience for both parties.

## Your Responsibilities as a Company Partner

- **Set clear goals, scope, and priorities** for the internship
- **Provide opportunities for regular check-ins** (minimum 1x per week recommended)
- **Act as a mentor** by offering guidance, coaching, and feedback
- **Maintain open, responsive communication**
- **Encourage development** of technical and product management skills
- **Support a final evaluation** and wrap-up discussion

## Setting Up for Success

### Before the Internship Starts

1. Define 1-3 key projects or focus areas for the intern
2. Identify who the intern will work with day-to-day
3. Prepare any necessary accounts, tools, or access
4. Schedule an onboarding meeting for the first day/week

### First Week

1. Share context about your company, team, and product
2. Walk through goals and expectations together
3. Establish communication norms (preferred channels, response times)
4. Set up recurring 1:1 meetings

## Effective Mentorship

### Weekly Check-ins

- Review progress on current tasks
- Discuss blockers and provide support
- Give feedback on work quality and approach
- Adjust priorities as needed

### Feedback Best Practices

- **Be specific** — point to concrete examples
- **Be timely** — don't wait until the end to share concerns
- **Balance** — acknowledge strengths alongside areas for growth
- **Be actionable** — provide clear guidance on how to improve

## What to Expect from Your Intern

Interns are expected to:

- Confirm expectations and ask clarifying questions
- Deliver high-quality work and meet deadlines
- Come prepared to meetings with updates and questions
- Engage actively and be open to feedback
- Proactively communicate progress, blockers, and availability
- Send weekly recap emails (every Saturday)

## Weekly Progress Emails

Your intern will send you an end-of-week update email every Saturday (CC'ing strategy-program@byu.edu) that includes:

1. What was accomplished that week
2. Plans and priorities for the coming week
3. Any blockers, risks, or dependencies

This keeps everyone aligned and creates a record of progress.
