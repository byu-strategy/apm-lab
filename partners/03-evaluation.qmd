# Evaluation

At the conclusion of the internship, mentors/managers complete a brief performance feedback survey. This feedback is a key input when assigning final grades.

## End-of-Term Feedback Survey

**Due Date:** April 15, 2026

## What the Survey Covers

The feedback survey asks you to evaluate your intern on:

- Quality of work delivered
- Communication and professionalism
- Initiative and problem-solving
- Reliability and follow-through
- Growth and learning throughout the term
- Overall performance

## Sharing Feedback

- Feedback is shared with the intern
- We encourage you to **discuss feedback verbally** with your intern as part of a wrap-up conversation
- This conversation is a valuable learning opportunity for the student

## Wrap-Up Conversation Tips

Consider discussing:

1. **Highlights** — What did they do well? What were you impressed by?
2. **Growth areas** — Where could they improve? What skills should they develop?
3. **Career advice** — What would help them succeed in product management?
4. **Next steps** — Are there opportunities to continue working together?
