# Evaluation

Mentors/managers complete a brief performance feedback survey twice during the semester, once at mid-term for developmental purposes and once at the end as an input into final grading.

## Feedback Survey

The feedback survey asks you to evaluate your intern on:

- **Timeliness** — Punctuality and meeting deadlines
- **Communication** — Effectiveness in verbal and written communications
- **High Agency** — Taking initiative, solving problems proactively, working independently
- **Technical Competency** — Developing knowledge and skills to complete work effectively
- **Contribution** — Consistently delivering high-quality work output

| Survey | Due Date | Purpose | Link |
|--------|----------|---------|------|
| Mid-term | February 28, 2026 | Developmental feedback only (no grade impact) | [Complete Mid-Term Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0W4ZOCw63lOU8IWSr3DpuBIe-OeaPOgT_u-0uGeOABpMXBw/viewform?usp=header) |
| End-of-term | April 15, 2026 | Final evaluation for grading | [Complete End-of-Term Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUlDUhDI8FNRMLk1YGNuAO6h8sFEfUYRTbplVsmFs_Nab81Q/viewform?usp=header) |

## Mid-Term Feedback

The mid-term [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0W4ZOCw63lOU8IWSr3DpuBIe-OeaPOgT_u-0uGeOABpMXBw/viewform?usp=header) gives interns a chance to understand where they stand halfway through the internship. This feedback:

- Has **no impact on their grade**
- Is purely developmental
- Helps interns course-correct if needed before the final evaluation
- Creates a natural checkpoint for mentoring conversations

After completing the mid-term survey, **you should have a live conversation with your intern** to discuss the feedback. This is an important part of the intern's development. You should:

- Schedule a meeting within a week of submitting your mid-term feedback
- Discuss your feedback and areas of strength and improvement

This conversation helps interns understand expectations and adjust before the final evaluation

### Mid-Term Conversation Guide

::: {.callout-tip}
**Make it a two-way conversation.** In addition to sharing your feedback, ask your intern for their feedback on their experience so far and anything you should consider adjusting.
:::

The mid-term conversation should be supportive and forward-looking focusing on helping your intern succeed.

**Suggested structure:**

1. **Strengths** — What's going well? What should they keep doing?
2. **Opportunities for growth** — Where can they grow before the end of term?
3. **Support offered** — What can you do to help them improve?
4. **Goals check-in** — Are they on track with internship objectives?
5. **Ask for feedback** — How can you better support them? What's working well?

**Tips for a productive conversation:**

- Be specific with examples rather than general statements
- Focus on behaviors and outcomes, not personality
- Ask questions and listen, letting them share their perspective
- End with clear, actionable next steps
- Keep the tone developmental

## End-of-Term Feedback

The end-of-term [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUlDUhDI8FNRMLk1YGNuAO6h8sFEfUYRTbplVsmFs_Nab81Q/viewform?usp=header) is your final evaluation and an important input into the intern's grade. This feedback is shared with the intern, so we encourage you to **discuss it verbally** as part of a wrap-up conversation. This conversation is a valuable learning opportunity for the student.

### End-of-Term Wrap-up Conversation Guide

The end-of-term conversation should be reflective and forward-looking, helping your intern understand their performance and prepare for their career.

**Suggested topics:**

1. **Highlights** — What did they do well? What were you impressed by?
2. **Growth areas** — Where could they improve? What skills should they develop?
3. **Career advice** — What would help them succeed in product management?
4. **Next steps** — Are there opportunities to continue working together over the summer or in the future?
5. **Ask for their feedback** — What could you do to improve as a mentor? What worked well?
