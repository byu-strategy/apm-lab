# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions from company partners about the APM Internship Program.

## Equipment & Resources

### Do I need to provide the intern with a laptop or equipment?

There is no requirement to provide equipment. Interns may use their own devices (BYOD). However, if you prefer the intern use a company device, you may issue them one.

### Do I need to provide a dedicated workspace?

Interns can work remotely or share space. There is no requirement to provide a dedicated desk or office.

## HR & Administrative

### Do I need to involve my HR department?

Each company is different. Many companies manage interns directly through the hiring manager or team lead without HR involvement. Others onboard the intern like a regular employee through their typical HR systems and practices. You should determine what is appropriate for your company.

### What paperwork is required?

After reviewing the Associate Product Manager Program overview, please email a confirmation of your understanding of these terms to strategy-program@byu.edu

### Is there a formal contract or agreement?

The email confirmation serves as acknowledgment of the program terms. If your company requires additional documentation, please contact the program director.

## Hours & Compensation

### How many hours per week should I expect?

- **Standard enrollment:** 10 hours per week (3.0 credit hours)
- **Extended enrollment:** Up to 20 hours per week (up to 6.0 credit hours)

The intern's enrollment determines their commitment level.

### Can I pay the intern?

Internships are unpaid for the hours associated with academic credit. However, companies may optionally offer compensation for any hours worked beyond the credit-bearing requirement.

### Can I extend the internship into summer?

Yes. Companies may choose to offer paid summer extensions following the academic term. Extensions are optional and not required as part of the program.

## Working Arrangements

### Can the intern work remotely?

Yes. Location is flexible—in-person or remote—depending on your company's needs and preferences.

### What if the intern isn't meeting expectations?

Communicate concerns early, both to the intern and to the program director. We can help facilitate conversations and provide support. Early intervention usually leads to better outcomes.
